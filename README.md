#### Integration of Blockchain in Recycling

**Objective:**
Use blockchain technology to enhance recycling through reverse vending machines (RVMs). Users deposit empty beverage containers and receive digital tokens as rewards.

**Technologies:**
- **Hedera Hashgraph:** Ensures fast and secure transactions.  (this will be implemented in a future)
- **IPFS:** Decentralized data storage.
- **OAuth 2.0 and MFA:** Security for digital wallets.

**Process:**
1. **User Registration and Wallet Creation:** Via app or web portal.
   
2. **Recycling and Scanning:** Users scan a QR code on the RVM to log their recycling action.
   
3.. **Verification and Token Issuance:** The action is verified, and tokens are credited to the userâ€™s digital wallet.

4. **Token Management:** Users check their token balance and redeem tokens for rewards or cash.

**Business Model:**

- **Token Economics:** Tokens are issued based on verified recycling actions.
- **Incentives:** Users earn tokens to exchange for rewards.
- **Interoperability:** API integration with partners for secure reward transfers.

**Benefits:**

- **Increased Recycling Rates:** Economic incentives via digital tokens.
- **Economic Opportunities:** New business models based on token economy.

**Considerations:**

- **Regulation and Security:** Compliance with regional regulations and security risk management.
- **Responsibility:** Clear accountability among stakeholders in the waste management ecosystem.

Integrating blockchain into recycling not only improves process efficiency and transparency but also promotes sustainable practices and offers economic benefits to participants.
